Basic Node.js Apollo Server for GraphQL

This project uses pnpm which stands for performant npm.
[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/pnpm-vs-npm) uses linking to a global content-adressable store on-disk to reduce disk usage. pnpm syntax is similar to npm.

This simple boilerplate project uses typescript.

`pnpm start` to start the server
